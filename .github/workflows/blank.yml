Sure! Hereâ€™s the workflow file tailored to your *Sakay* chat app's CI pipeline, considering you are using Flutter. This file will handle setting up the environment, installing dependencies, running tests, building the app, and preparing it for deployment.

```yaml
name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Sets up Flutter environment
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.7.0' # Specify the Flutter version you're using

      # Caches Flutter dependencies to speed up workflow
      - name: Cache Flutter dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.pub-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-${{ hashFiles('**/pubspec.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-

      # Installs Flutter dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # Runs tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly
      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test

      # Build the Flutter app for Android
      - name: Build APK (Android)
        run: flutter build apk --release

      # Optionally, if you want to build for iOS, uncomment the line below:
      # - name: Build iOS
      #   run: flutter build ios --release

      # Optionally, add deployment steps (e.g., upload to stores or internal services)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Set up Flutter**: Configures the Flutter SDK to ensure the correct version is used.
2. **Cache Flutter dependencies**: Caches the dependencies to speed up future builds.
3. **Install dependencies**: Ensures that the necessary Flutter dependencies are installed.
4. **Run tests**: Executes unit tests for your app using `flutter test`.
5. **Build APK (Android)**: Builds the app for Android release using `flutter build apk --release`. For iOS, you can uncomment the `flutter build ios --release` command.
6. **Deployment (Optional)**: You can add steps to deploy the built app (e.g., upload to Firebase, app stores, or other platforms).
